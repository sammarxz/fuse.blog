# fuse.blog

Hello Internet. I am currently studying Vue.JS and I decided to create this Reddit clone based on the http://fuse.blog design. I also implemented a simple web crawler in Python to be able to grab the information from the site and save it to a JSON.

## Features:
- Dark/Light theme
- Upvote on links
- web crawler (Python)
